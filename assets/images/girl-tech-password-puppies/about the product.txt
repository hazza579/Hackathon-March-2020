Girl Tech claims Password Puppies are the first voice activated virtual pet for girls. 
They can be named and trained by talking to them. The puppy can sit, roll over,
and dance. It comes with a nice fold out stand and a few control buttons in a pawprint layout.

The puppy will only respond to your voice. It uses similar technology from their Password Journal,
a notebook diary that can only be unlocked by your voice.
