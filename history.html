<h4>Who is Janese Swanson?</h4>
<p>Janese Swanson is an American inventor and software developer. 
Getting young girls interested in science and technology has always been a challenge so Janese Swanson, founded Girl Tech to change that.  Her company specialized in creating toys and other products aimed at making technology more interesting for girls.
</p>
<h4>Early Life:</h4>
<p>Janese was raised by her mother in San Diego, California, after her father was killed in the Vietnam War. She was the second oldest in a household of six kids, had to help take care of her younger siblings and run things at home while her mom worked two jobs. Money was tight, and Swanson taught herself to fix things around the house out of necessity but also because she loved it. <br>  Her grandfather pushed her to become a fashion model, which she did, and she gained valuable experience through learning about styling and layouts and discovered her a talent for design.
</p>
<h4>Education:</h4>
<p>She graduated from Orange Glen High School in 1975. <br>
She earned a bachelor's degree in liberal studies in 1981 from San Diego State University
and continued her studies, eventually earning a total of seven academic degrees including a doctorate in organization and leadership, with a doctoral thesis on gender issues in product design, play patterns and gender preferences</p>
<h4>Her Inventions:</h4>  
<p>Back when Janese Swanson was creating tech games for kids she was thinking about her own daughter. So, in 1995 Janese decided that she wanted to create toys aimed specifically at girls and founded Girl Tech. <br>

She invented gadgets for her daughter, including a voice recording device that she hoped to install in Jackie's daycare cubby and in her own office. 
</p>
<h4>Fun Facts:</h4>
<p>Janese became a flight attendant after her school experienced lay-offs, and in her spare time she used donated laptops to teach her fellow flight attendants computer skills.</p>

<p>When Janese’s first licensed product a handheld toy that would record and play back a child’s voice – was set to be released, Janese and her daughter were excited to see a tech toy marketed to both girls and boys. But when they watched the first YakBak commercial, they were upset to see that it featured a boy using the toy to argue with and ignore his sister. After another iteration of the toy was marketed as the TalkBoy FX®, Janese knew that something had to change.</p>
